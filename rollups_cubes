-- OPERATORS: GROUPING SETS, ROLLUP AND CUBE

-- GROUPING SETS allows to provide a breakdown of units sold by continent, country and city in one query.

SELECT continent, country, city, SUM(units_sold)
FROM sales
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS(continent, country, city); -- provides a breakdown individually / separedately


-- To provide the Grand Total

SELECT continent, country, city, SUM(units_sold)
FROM sales
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS(continent, country, city, ()); -- Empty brackets will provide the total sum and it won't group by anything

-- ROLLUP: It provides the Grand Total as well as the result if we were to group by any of the categories
-- Example: Continent, Country and City, Continent and Country and Country

SELECT continent, country, city, SUM(units_sold)
FROM sales
GROUP BY ROLLUP(continent, country, city); 


-- CUBE: It's provides more combination then the ROLLUP. It explores all possible combinations used in the GROUP BY clause.

SELECT continent, country, city, SUM(units_sold)
FROM sales
GROUP BY CUBE(continent, country, city);
