-- LEAD and LAG: These functions are helpful because they allow us to work with other records relative to the current record.
-- Use case: get the values from a row that is directly above or directly below the currently processing row.
-- Obviously, the last row will be blank when using LEAD.
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary,
LEAD(salary) OVER() next_salary
FROM employees;

-- Same goes for LAG, the first row will be blank
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary,
LAG(salary) OVER() previous_salary
FROM employees;

-- USE CASES:
-- Closest Lower Salary by Department (resets for each department)
SELECT department, last_name, salary,
LEAD(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) closest_lower_salary
FROM employees;

-- Closest Higher Salary by Department (resets for each department)
SELECT department, last_name, salary,
LAG(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) closest_higher_salary
FROM employees;
