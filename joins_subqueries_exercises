-- Provide the first name, department, hire date and country of the first and last employee hired

-- 1st approach 
SELECT first_name, hire_date, department, country 

FROM (
SELECT first_name, hire_date, department, region_id,
(SELECT MIN(hire_date) FROM employees) first_hire,
(SELECT MAX(hire_date) FROM employees) last_hire

FROM employees 	
) emp
INNER JOIN regions
ON emp.region_id = regions.region_id
WHERE hire_date = first_hire OR hire_date = last_hire
ORDER BY emp.hire_date DESC		
LIMIT 2;


-- 2nd approach with UNION
(SELECT first_name, department, hire_date, country
FROM employees e INNER JOIN regions r
ON e.region_id = r.region_id
WHERE hire_date = (SELECT MIN(hire_date) FROM employees e2)
LIMIT 1)

UNION 

SELECT first_name, department, hire_date, country
FROM employees e INNER JOIN regions r
ON e.region_id = r.region_id
WHERE hire_date = (SELECT MAX(hire_date) FROM employees e2)
ORDER BY hire_date DESC
;
