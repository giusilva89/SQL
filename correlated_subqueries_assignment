-- Department, First name, their salary and highest and lowest salary (as label). 

-- Sort by department ascending and by salary descending.

-- First solution
SELECT department, first_name, salary,
CASE 
	WHEN salary = 
	(SELECT MAX(salary)
	 FROM employees e2
	 WHERE e1.department = e2.department)  THEN 'HIGHEST SALARY'
	WHEN salary = 
	(SELECT MIN(salary)
	 FROM employees e2
	 WHERE e1.department = e2.department)  THEN 'LOWEST SALARY'
END as category
FROM employees e1
WHERE salary = (SELECT MAX(salary)
			FROM employees e2
			WHERE e1.department = e2.department) 
			OR
	 salary = (SELECT MIN(salary)
			FROM employees e2
			WHERE e1.department = e2.department)
ORDER BY department ASC, salary DESC;			


-- Optimised approach
SELECT department, first_name, salary,

CASE 
	WHEN salary = max_department_salary THEN 'HIGHEST SALARY'
	WHEN salary = min_department_salary THEN 'LOWEST SALARY'
END
FROM(

SELECT department, first_name, salary,
(SELECT ROUND(MAX(salary))
			  FROM employees e2 WHERE e1.department = e2.department) as max_department_salary,
	
(SELECT ROUND(MIN(salary))
			  FROM employees e2 WHERE e1.department = e2.department) as min_department_salary
	
FROM employees e1
) a

WHERE salary = max_department_salary OR salary = min_department_salary
ORDER BY department;
